# Challenge 2
The user inputs a simple chemical formula. Your program should find the molecular weight of formula.

To find the weight of a molecule, multiply the atomic weight of each element by the number of atoms of that element. Add the weights of the individual elements together. Eg: Molecular weight of H2SO4 = 2 * (atomic weight of H) + (atomic weight of S) + 4 * (atomic weight of O). You can find a list of all atomic weights [here](https://www.science.co.il/elements). 

## Example

### Input 1
```
H2SO4
```

### Output 1
```
H2SO4
```

### Input 2
```
(CH3)2CHOH
```

### Output 2
```
60.0947
```
